Web Developer | Recent Bootcamp Graduate

//

Hello, my name's Kyle McParland, and I'm a full-stack developer from Toronto, Ontario. I graduated from Lighthouse Labs' 30-Week Web Development Program in January 2025, where I discovered my passion for programming and web design. I specialize in creating dynamic web applications using JavaScript technologies like Node.js, Express, and React, along with relational databases such as PostgreSQL. I’m passionate about building clean, user-friendly front-end designs and writing modular, maintainable back-end code that follows best practices.

I’m eager to break into the industry and contribute to a dynamic team. I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with talented professionals, tackle complex problems, and continue growing as a developer. Currently, I’m looking for a role where I can leverage my skills, work on impactful projects, and continue to push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
